chamsou962: hello
browndog7912: I like the project very much but i think the upgrades should be more cheaper because its a bit hard to get the upgrades when you start the game. Otherwise the game is super good! Great Work!
player2382: Cool game sad pin won in bfdia 19b
trifflethumbjimmy: how did you make save data and load data buttons
bse: game good add more
player7332: for whatever reason the coiny upgrades are giving the wrong amount. instead of nickel giving 5 he gives 2, and the coiny factory gives 3, and nickel (with hole) gives 4. and so on.
ianojo90thecreator: you are the best!
